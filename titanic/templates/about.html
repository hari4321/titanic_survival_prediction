                    RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, which sank in the North
                    Atlantic
                    Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, England,
                    to New York
                    City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making
                    it the
                    deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time. It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an
                    ocean
                    liner or cruise ship. The disaster drew public attention, provided foundational material for the
                    disaster
                    film genre, and has inspired many artistic works.

                    RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three
                    Olympic-class
                    ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in
                    Belfast. Thomas
                    Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. Titanic was under the
                    command of
                    Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest
                    people in the
                    world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia, and elsewhere
                    throughout
                    Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.

                    The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a
                    gymnasium, swimming
                    pool, smoking rooms, high-class restaurants and cafes, a Turkish bath and hundreds of opulent
                    cabins. A
                    high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger "marconigrams" and for
                    the ship's
                    operational use. Titanic had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely
                    activated
                    watertight doors, contributing to its reputation as "unsinkable".
